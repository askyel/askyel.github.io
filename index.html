			Many participants considered entrepreneurial ventures as a way of responding to these impediments in the paid labor force… Importantly, our participants’ accounts demonstrate that people of colour, particularly black women, develop intersectional counterframes that are motivated by their own shared experiences with multiple dimensions of social marginalization.
		</div>
		<div class="caption">
			This quote is from a study on how race, gender, and class affect black business owners. At the intersection of multiple dimensions of marginalization, a motivating factor to seek non-traditional career paths, black women are noted as one of the most proportionally entrepreneurial populations in the United States.

			Venture capital is one of the most valuable sources of seed money for a company, but only 2% of VC (venture capitalist) funding goes to women. This chart illustrates how VCs approach pitch meetings differently based on the gender of the founder, one with the expectation of success and the other with the expectation of failure. Notably, this is true of both male and female VCs.

			Lindsay Meyer, an entrepreneur in San Francisco, said Mr. Caldbeck put $25,000 of his own money into her fitness start-up in 2015. That gave Mr. Caldbeck reason to constantly text her; in those messages, reviewed by The Times, he asked if she was attracted to him and why she would rather be with her boyfriend than him. At times, he groped and kissed her, she said.“I felt like I had to tolerate it because this is the cost of being a nonwhite female founder,” said Ms. Meyer, who is Asian-American.

			In a New York Times article published earlier this year, over two dozen women came forward with allegations of sexual harassment against some of the most powerful male venture capitalists in the industry. When women did protest or push back, firms often retaliated by ending funding negotiations.

			These two charts illustrate statistics on women-owned businesses in the United States from a 2017 report published by American Express. While the quantity of businesses owned by women has risen in the last decade, their overall share of market employment and revenue has not changed significantly. Notably, there is little overlap between the industries most popular for women-owned businesses and industries in which they scale the most.

			Being a mom makes me a fair and generous manager and owner. It  helps me to support my employees in finding the work/family balance.  I love my job and my company, but instead of it consuming me the way it did in my 20s it is a wonderful part of my life.  My boys come first.

			Photographed here is Jennifer Hyman, founder and CEO of Rent the Runway. Her company, started eight years ago, has raised $176 million in funding. Last year, the fashion-rental company served six million customers and reported $100 million in revenue. The first picture is from a 2014 article, before she is a mother, on Rent the Runway's breakthroughs in the tech industry and application of data science to fashion. The second picture is from a 2017 article, after she is a mother, on Hyman's personal struggles with sexism in founding and scaling her company.
